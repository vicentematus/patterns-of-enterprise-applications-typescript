[See what the book is about.](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/)

Based on DHH - [The five programming books that meant most to me](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me).

[See notes on my website (spanish)](https://notas.vicentematus.cl/Libros/Patterns-of-Enterprise-Application-Architecture---Martin-Fowler). This is currently WIP. 

Implementing the patterns on Typescript to understand more what Martin Fowler is trying to explain.

## How to run this

First, [install Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/).

To install dependencies on the root folder:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun --hot <path-to-pattern>
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
